        <h2>About Lana</h2>
        <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Recognized for her songwriting, musical versatility, artistic reinventions, and influence on the music industry, she is a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century.<br><br> Swift began professional songwriting at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. Under Big Machine, she released six studio albums, four of them to country radio, starting with her self-titled album in 2006. Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to prominence. Speak Now (2010) incorporated rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift" class="taylor_wiki"><p>Read Wiki</p></a></p>

                <h3 class="album-title">Ultraviolence (Highlight: 'Shades of Cool')</h3>
                <p>After the slow-burn success of “Born To Die,” Del Rey was positioned to be the crossover alt-pop queen of the 2010s. But instead of diving deeper into the emo-balladry and hip-hop-laced bops of her debut, she turned to the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach for a down-and-dirty rock album that simmers with dread, discontent and rage. If “Born to Die” was forged from California dreams, “Ultraviolence” was conjured by L.A. nightmares.</p>

                <h3 class="album-title">Red (Taylor’s Version) (2021)</h3>
                <p>On 2012’s ‘Red’, Swift began her transition from country crossover artist to creating glossy, mainstream pop; on its 2021 re-record we were reminded just what a superb songwriter Swift has always been. ‘Red’ is filled with top notch tunes: the brilliantly snarky ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together’ (Swift’s first ever Billboard 100 Number One) and fizzing ’22’ are stone-cold smashers. ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’, with its swift-step breakdown, saw her signature sound infused with trendy dance production.</p>

                <h3 class="album-title">Evermore (2020)</h3>
                <p>Taylor Swift described it as a sister record to the ‘Folklore’; where that record allowed her to completely reinvent her sound, coupling her trademark hooks and vibrant storytelling with indie-folk instrumentals, ‘Evermore’ exudes a new sense of confidence. There’s a free-wheeling, carefree attitude to the collection.</p>

                <h3 class="album-title">Folklore (2020)</h3>
                <p>Swift’s surprise eighth album arrived with very little fanfare. Casting aside the usual lengthy album campaigns or meticulously planned drip-feeding of singles, T-Swiz uncharacteristically announced ‘Folklore’ the day before it was released.  It’s not just the shock drop that felt different, though, as musically it saw Swift dive head-first into a new sonic palette of wistful indie-folk.</p>

                <h3 class="album-title">Midnights (2022)</h3>
                <p>Swift’s most recent release is a glittering return to pure-pop music. After embracing folk-flecked sounds on sister albums ‘Folklore’ and ‘Evermore’, for ‘Midnights’ Swift instead turns to bubbling synths and percussive beats, this sleek production run under the artist’s late night musings.</p>

                <h3 class="album-title">Fearless (2021)</h3>
                <p>If ‘Teardrops on My Guitar’ from Swift’s debut album was her breakthrough song, it was ‘Love Story’, the ballad from its follow-up ‘Fearless’, that cemented her name in the pop history books. On Swift’s second album she still kept things country, but this time the pop edge that defined later releases was more evident. Songs like ‘Love Story’, ‘You Belong with Me’ and ‘Fifteen’, filled with heart-on-sleeve lyrics and earworm hooks, remain among her best.</p>
